# whencompound
This is my first program I've made so any advice on the syntax or layout would be greatly appreciated. 

I made this because I wanted to see if there was much benefit, & specifically how much, to compounding more than once daily on my node returns. I wasn't about to spend the $AVAX it costs to do it if it wasn't worth it.

My results were that, in my opinion, the difference between any amount more than once daily is a waste. 

Specifically, I'm using $MAGIA which allows for compounding up to 6x daily, that's why the time variables I've chosen are here. 

*THIS IS NOT CODED TO INCLUDE THE BONUSES THAT MAGIA OFFERS AS WELL*

You can change around the inputs yourself and see what you think. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
*These instructions assume you already have python installed and have at least a slight bit of familiarity with how to run a python program*

1. run whencompound.py by typing "python3 whencompound.py" 
2. It will ask you for 
   A.) A starting amount. You must use a whole number. 
   B.) How long you'd like to see answers for. Must be a whole number of days.
   C.) How much percent you're getting returned daily. This number can be a whole number or     
       a float. EX: Enter it as "1" for 1 percent, or "5.5" for 5 & a half percent. 
   D.) Click enter after each amount is entered. 

What it shows you: 

This program calculates how much you would earn compounding at different time intervals, starting amounts, and frequency of compounding.
